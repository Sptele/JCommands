# JCommands
JCommands is a framework that provides a simple command interface for you to use.

 * A simple but modular command framework that is designed to make your command infrastructure as easy as possible.
 * The commands contain a name, flags that have parameters, flags that do not have parameters, and arguments.
 * The setup process is pretty simple:
 * Create a CommandConfigurator using the default Constructor.
 * Configure the settings to your liking.
 * And build it to create a CommandManager!
 * You then create a Command, and do what you want in it!
